# Tutorials

### Complete Tutorials

These tutorials explain how to use Kivy (especially with Ninja-IDE) to
program applications for console, windows, 2D graphics, and
introductory 3D graphics. Geany or one of the editors below are
recommended now, since Ninja-IDE doesn't seem to be maintained.

The tutorials were written for formal training (9 lessons per quarter),
so the instructions say to save to H: or T:\\<username> (if you are at a
school teaching this course). If you are learning at home like most
people, instead save to whatever folder you would like to use as your
Kivy projects folder (if using PyCharm or LiClipse, make a different
folder for each project), and instead of getting example files from
Resources (R: if you are at a school teaching this course) just get the
example files from wherever you saved the files from the link below
(non-tutorial data files may be found at
[expertmultimedia.com/resources](http://expertmultimedia.com/resources/)
(if not, please notify me of anything the tutorials request that is
missing). Though these instructions say to use Geany (which requires
the least configuration), you could use
[PyCharm](kivy-pycharm.md)
for better autocomplete (avoid Ninja-IDE 2.3 which as code-eating bugs
and autotypes too many quotes often), or you can also use
[LiClipse](kivy-liclipse.md)
if configured for Kivy such as by using the instructions on [this
page](kivy-liclipse.md).
