# Python 3 Introduction

I recommend Python 3 due to a unified way of doing multithreading and
[other reasons](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3). that
can be used to develop mobile applications with directmedia
(highly-optimized graphics and sound) using Kivy.

Use the links on the left for more information.

### Why Kivy?

Kivy has GUI, 2D Graphics, and 3D Graphics all in one framework. The
fact that all of these features are available and that Kivy is released
under a public license is an amazing achievement. The future of Kivy
looks bright, and due to the public license, anyone can pick up where
the original developers left off (though they seem to be developing
Kivy quite actively for several years now even after cross platform
including mobile release). This guide provides helpful examples for
even beginners to use Kivy. I have used and improved this system for
years and have helped many beginners create applications and games.
