# Python 2 Programming Tutorials

### Complete Tutorials (console, wxPython, and Panda3D):

The tutorials were written for formal training (9 lessons per quarter),
so the instructions say to save to H: or T:\\_username_. If you are
learning at home like most people, instead save to whatever folder you
would like to use as your kivy projects folder, and instead of getting
example files from Resources (drive R: if you are at a school teaching
this course) just get the example files from wherever you saved the
files from the download link below.
