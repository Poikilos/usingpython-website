# Installing wxPython

### (Python 2 only)

- Make sure you have completed the instructions for "Installing Python 2".
- Install wxPython from
  [wxpython.org](http://wxpython.org/download.php): make sure you get
  the **py27 32-bit unicode** version so it works with other libraries
  you may have installed.
- Now, for a wxPython form designer (almost but not quite IDE, can't run
  or debug) you can use
  [wxGlade](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxglade/) from
  sourceforge.net/projects/wxglade.
