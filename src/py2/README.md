# Python 2 Introduction

### Getting started with python 2 (Python 2.7, wxPython, Pygame, and Panda3D)

I do not recommend choosing Python 2 unless required by your project,
due to multiple ways of implementing multithreading, and other
developer regrets that were fixed in Python 3. See [the official python
3 changes page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) for more
information.

For wxPython and Panda3D, you must stay with Python 2.7 until they are
available for Python 3.

Python 2 should work on Windows, Mac, & Linux.

To install Python and related libraries such as Pygame for Python 2,
wxPython, and Panda3D, click one of the tutorials on the left.
