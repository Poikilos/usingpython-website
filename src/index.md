features:
- title: Designed for Printing
  details: 'The materials are condensed to fit on 8.5x11 printouts, saving paper along the way. Following along on a single monitor is unlikely to work well in schools or many other situations! A dual monitor setup is recommended if you do not print the materials.'
- title: Discreet Units
  details: 'This book is great for schools because it is split into two 9-week parts, such as for a middle school or high school semester (9 weeks per quarter).'
- title: Tested
  details: 'The original drafts (2015-2018) were tested and refined for years using feedback from around 100 real school-age learners.'

## What is "Python"?

Python is a modern, network-capable script language that can be precompiled for speed. Python has a well-maintained interpreter and has a comprehensive set of tools, and there are well-maintained libraries for multimedia decoding and display.

## What is "Using Python"?

Using Python is a specialized [Expert Multimedia](http://www.expertmultimedia.com) course written by Jacob Gustafson to fill the gap in Python training materials. Since Python is often used by the open-source community where projects are often maintained by a tightly-knit group of experts, most Python books & courses are not intended for beginners. The few books that receive good reviews from users do not have the most up-to-date information on Python. Using Python covers Python 2 and 3, which both have extensive ecosystems, having many libraries for networking, GUI, website creation, & direct media. The Using Python course makes learning Python programming accessible, by providing training instead of merely summarizing the [Python documentation](http://docs.python.org/) which is the goal of most forum answers and publications, and provides real-world examples for console, GUI (using wxPython for Python 2, Kivy for Python 3), & direct media (using Pygame and Panda3D for Python 2, Kivy for Python 3). Python 2 is [no longer officially supported](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) as of January 1, 2020.
